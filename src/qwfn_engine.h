// The engine: position-tracked evaluation over a growing sequence.
//
// Two paths, because the MoE behaves differently by batch size:
//
//   decode  (1 token)  every layer selects exactly n_expert_used experts, so the
//                      expert cache serves them and each runs one matmul in
//                      place from VRAM or RAM.
//   prefill (N tokens) each token picks its own experts, so the per-layer union
//                      approaches all 512. That is a streaming pass, not a
//                      caching one -- each expert is read once and reused across
//                      all its tokens -- so it reads from the mmap'd file and
//                      leaves the cache undisturbed for decode.
//
// State (KV, indexer keys, DeltaNet recurrence, conv history) persists across
// calls; n_past advances.
